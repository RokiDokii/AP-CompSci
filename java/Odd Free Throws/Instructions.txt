Your club basketball has had 5 games so far. Your teammates are math-minded and they want to know their average free-throws so far. Also, you want to give them an odd extra bit of information, which is telling them whether their average, truncated to an integer, is even or odd.

To do:

1. Ask the user for the number of free throws for the last five games. You must use 5 prompts for this, and the numbers must be saved as integers. (6 points)

2. Calculate the average free throws between these games, and display this number as an accurate decimal. (2 points)

3. Convert the average to an integer, and print a 1 if this integer is odd or a 0 if this integer is even. (2 points)

Sample Run

How about in game 2?

>3

In game 3?

>10

In game 4?

>9

In game 5?

>2

Wow! Your average number of free throws is 4.2!

As an integer, the average is 4. Printing 0 for even, and 1 for odd: 0
